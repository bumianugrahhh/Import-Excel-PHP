# Import Employee Attendance Data in Excel Format to Insert Into MySQL Database Using PHP : Project Overview
- Served as a web developer at the Badan Kepegawaian dan Pengembangan Sumber Daya Manusia (BKPSDM) Kabupaten Buol.
- Use the PHPSpreadSheet library and install it using Composer.

## Background
All employees in Buol District in the attendance process still use mobile applications provided by the Central Government. In addition, the Buol District Government has its own staffing website, but it does not yet have an attendance feature and also does not have an API from the Central Government's mobile application. Therefore, the Buol Personnel website attendance recap format is equated with the format of the central government mobile application attendance recap results, so that later we only need to download the recap results from the mobile application and upload them to the website without the need for format adjustments first.

## Goal
Accelerate employee performance by 20% in inputting attendance recap data to the Buol District staffing website.
